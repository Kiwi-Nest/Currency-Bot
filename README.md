## Features for Staff & Developers

### Moderation Suite üõ°Ô∏è

All moderation actions are slash commands and are automatically logged to your designated mod-log channel.

- **`/moderate ban <member>`**: Bans a user, with options to delete their recent message history.
- **`/moderate kick <member>`**: Kicks a user from the server.
- **`/moderate timeout <member> <duration>`**: Times out a user for a specified duration (e.g., `10m`, `2h`, `7d`).
- **`/moderate untimeout <member>`**: Removes an active timeout from a user.
- **`/moderate mute <member>`**: Mutes a user by assigning the configured `MUTED_ROLE_ID`.
- **`/moderate unmute <member>`**: Removes the muted role from a user.

### Automation & Management ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Automated Logging**:
  - **Mod Log**: A detailed feed of all moderation actions (bans, kicks, mutes, timeouts), including the responsible moderator and provided reason.
  - **Join/Leave Log**: A clean announcement log for when members join, rejoin, or leave the server.
- **Server Stats Channels**: Automatically updates the names of designated voice channels to display live server statistics like the total member count.
- **Automatic Role Pruning**:
  - **Inactive Members**: Keeps your member list tidy by removing specified roles from users who have been inactive for a configurable period. It also cleans up common cosmetic roles (e.g., `Colour:`, `Ping:`, `Gradient:`).
  - **Old Custom Roles**: Automatically deletes roles prefixed with `Custom:` after 30 days to prevent role clutter.
- **Smart Bump Reminders**: The bot pings the `BUMPER_ROLE_ID` two hours after a successful bump. If no one bumps after 10 more minutes, it pings the `BACKUP_BUMPER_ROLE_ID`.

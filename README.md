- `TOKEN`: Your unique Discord bot token.
- `GUILD_ID`: The ID of the server where the bot will operate.
- `ROLES_TO_PRUNE`: A comma-separated list of role IDs to be removed from inactive users.
- `INACTIVITY_DAYS`: The number of days a user must be inactive to have their roles pruned.
- `DISBOARD_BOT_ID`: The channel where bumps occur and the ID of the bump bot for the reward system.
- `JOIN_LEAVE_LOG_CHANNEL_ID`: The channel where member join/leave messages will be sent.
- `MOD_CHANNEL_ID`: The channel for logging moderation actions.

#### 2\. Running the Bot

This project uses `uv` for dependency management and execution.

1.  Get `uv` by following the installation instructions at [https://docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).
2.  Run the bot from your terminal. `uv` will automatically install the required dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and run the script.
    ```shell
    uv run main.py
    ```

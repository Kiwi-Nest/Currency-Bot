# Best Practices

## Coding
- Pycharm is recommended.
- Use ruff for linting and formatting.
- Always use type annotations
- Use pathlib instead of open()
- Catch the exact Exception type like ValueError instead of the generic "Exception" when possible
- Use async code

## Other
- Use squash to merge pull requests.
